## The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity

The basic laws assert that @cipolla2021

1.  There will always be more stupid people than you think

2.  The proportion of stupid people is invariant to intellectual, social or geographic segmentation

3.  A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and possibly incurring losses

4.  Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals
