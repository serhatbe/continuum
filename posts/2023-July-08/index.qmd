## Brief Summary

In traditional Japanese aesthetics **wabi-sabi** (侘寂) is a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of appreciating beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete" in nature. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi)
