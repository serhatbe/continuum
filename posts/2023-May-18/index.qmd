## Choices

I tried several options:

-   Static site generators, Jekyll-based options and Python scripts

-   Simple html files using Notepad++ to build a website to hold my notes

Then I'm back to .md files using Zettlr, because it supports:

-   Math typesetting i.e. good $\LaTeX$ support.

-   Easy input of more commands in .md than in .html using Notepad++

-   Easy .html and .pdf generation

-   Citation built-in with Zotero

But I discovered [Quarto](https://quarto.org) which is a scientific and technical publishing system utilizing [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). It does everything Zettlr does but in style. But Zettlr is still best for raw note-taking.
