  {"id":"clearyTrainingSamuraiMind2009","abstract":"A fascinating, eclectic collection of writings—spanning four hundred years—on samurai ethos, training, and education, from premier translator Thomas Cleary Through the ages, the samurai have been associated with honor, fearlessness, calm, decisive action, strategic thinking, and martial prowess. Their ethos is known as bushido, the Way of the Warrior-Knight.Here, premier translator Thomas Cleary presents a rich collection of writings on bushido by warriors, scholars, political advisors, and educators from the fifteenth century through the nineteenth century that provide a comprehensive, historically rich view of samurai life and philosophy. Training the Samurai Mind gives an insider’s view of the samurai world: the moral and psychological development of the warrior, the ethical standards they were meant to uphold, their training in both martial arts and strategy, and the enormous role that the traditions of Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism had in influencing samurai ideals.The writings deal with a broad range of subjects—from military strategy and political science, to personal discipline and character development. Cleary introduces each piece, putting it into historical context, and presents biographical information about the authors. This is an essential read for anyone interested in military history and samurai history, and for martial artists who want to understand strategy.","author":[{"family":"Cleary","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"clearyTrainingSamuraiMind2009","ISBN":"978-1-59030-721-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,6]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Shambhala","source":"Amazon","title":"Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook","title-short":"Training the Samurai Mind","type":"book"},

We live ina world full of people with extraordinary abilities. Consider what Roger Federer can do with a tennis ball, or Connor McDavid with a puck. There are chess grandmasters who can play several dozen different games simultaneously--while blindfolded--and a seemingly unending supply of young musical prodigies who would have astonished aficionados a century ago. We are dramatically better at just about everything than we were just a generation ago. We assume, though, that these peak performers are the lucky ones, the ones with a gift. That's only partly true.The fact is we are all lucky. We all have that gift. As Ericsson's whole career has shown, with the proper practice, we are all capable of extraordinary feats. On the surface, the techniques that chess players use to develop their skills seem quite different from the methodssoccer players use to perfect their games, which in turn seem quite different from how pianists improve their playing. But at a deeper level, they are all variations ona single fundamental approach to learning, what Ericsson, a world-renowned researcher, has named \"deliberate practice\": a simple, yet powerful system for enhancing learning. This approach to expertise has the potential to revolutionize how we think about every sort of education and training. We are not limited by an endowment of natural talent. We create our own limits. Whether you wantto step up your game at work or on the weekend, or help your kid achieve athletic or academic goals, Ericsson's revolutionary methods will show you how to master almost anything.\"--","author":[{"family":"Ericsson","given":"K.
