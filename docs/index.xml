<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="focusing-illusion">Focusing Illusion</h2>
<p>The idea that you can be focused on a particular aspect of life, so much so that you can believe that your whole happiness depends on it. In having a focusing illusion, you create your own reason for feeling unhappy. <span class="citation" data-cites="mogi2018">Mogi (2018)</span></p>
<p>If unhappiness is a vacuum in which the required element is absent, the vacuum is created by the biased imagination of the subject. There is no absolute formula for happiness - each unique condition of life can serve as the foundation for happiness in its own unique way. <span class="citation" data-cites="mogi2018">Mogi (2018)</span></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One reason we have so much trouble fixing chronic degenerative conditions is that we need to remove elements before we can start building new functions. If we simply put effort on top of a shaky foundation, it'll all be wasted. The best way forward might be to take a few steps back.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-third-law-of-stupidity">The Third Law of Stupidity</h2>
<p>Reasonable people have q hard time imagining unreasonable behavior. A stupid person is one who causes harm to others while gaining nothing and even harming himself in doing so. (See <span class="citation" data-cites="cipolla2021">Cipolla and Taleb (2021)</span>)</p>
<p>A stupid person will harass you with no reason. You have no rational way of telling if and when and how and why the stupid creature attacks. When confronted with a stupid individual, you’re completely at his mercy. Because the stupid person’s actions do not conform to the rules of rationality. From all that proceeds:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You’re caught by surprise.</li>
<li>You cannot build a rational defence because the attack lacks any rational structure.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="cipolla2021">Cipolla and Taleb (2021)</span> classify four types of people, comments are mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helpless: Identify and help the helpless.</li>
<li>Intelligent: Identify and surround yourself with intelligent people.</li>
<li>Bandit: Identify and utilise bandits with great caution when circumstances demand it.</li>

  <title>The Case for Daydreaming</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-June-12/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="default-mode-network" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="default-mode-network">Default Mode Network</h2>
<p>In neuroscience, the&nbsp;default mode network&nbsp;(DMN), also known as the&nbsp;default network,&nbsp;default state network is best known for being active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at&nbsp;wakeful rest, such as during&nbsp;daydreaming and&nbsp;mind-wandering. It can also be active during detailed thoughts related to external task performance. Other times that the DMN is active include when the individual is thinking about others, thinking about themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">Default mode network</a>)</p>
</section>
<section id="mind-wandering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mind-wandering">Mind-wandering</h2>
<p>Mind-wandering is a broad term with no currently universal definition. According to McMillan, Kaufmann and Singer (2013) mind-wandering consists of 3 different subtypes: positive constructive daydreaming, guilty fear of failure, and poor attentional control. Whereas Smallwood and Schooler (2015) suggest that mind-wandering consists of thoughts that are task-unrelated and stimulus-independent. In general, a folk explanation of mind-wandering could be described as the experience of thoughts not remaining on a single topic for a long period of time, particularly when people are engaged in an attention-demanding task. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-wandering">Mind-wandering</a>)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-takeaways-from-ubc-magazine">Key Takeaways from UBC Magazine</h2>
<p>In a cumulative and worrying way, the smart phones might be making us stupid.</p>
<p>This is no mere speculation. On the increasingly rare occasion when we let our minds wander, the blood in our brains rushes to what is called the default network.</p>
<p>The default network: a vital support centre for spontaneous thought, a creative space that helps us through our thoughts and experiences. But goal driven thinking happens in another part of the brain, disconnects us from the fullness of our experience. (See <a href="https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kalina-christoff/">Kalina Christoff)</a></p>

  <title>Negative Utility</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-June-10/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>You need a book, a pen, and time. More tools give you negative utility. They won’t make the work go faster. But they will consume as much time as you are willing to waste. Productivity advice</p>
<p>Do the work.</p>
<p>That’s all the productivity advice you need, and the only useful productivity advice you’re ever going to get.</p>
<p>You can direct your attention to a million optimization— email, meetings, notes, calendar, time tracking, goals, to-do lists, time estimates, prioritization frameworks, quantified self sensors, analytics, apps, documents, journaling.</p>
<p>But don’t. Ignore all this, and do the work. When you do the work, everything else optimizes itself.</p>

  <title>Truth-default Theory</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-June-9/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Proposed by philosophers and recently supported by experimental psychologists, there’s considerable evidence showing that if we hear something, we assume it to be true. This tendency is sometimes referred to as <strong>truth-default theory</strong>.</p>
<section id="truth-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="truth-bias">Truth Bias</h3>
<p>Truth bias is people’s inclination towards believing, to some degree, the communication of another person, regardless of whether or not that person is actually lying or being untruthful It is human nature to believe communication is honest, which in turn makes humans highly vulnerable to deception. Consequently, a person’s ability to detect deception is weakened, particularly when the source of deception is unfamiliar. As long as a person already has the perception that everything they are told is true, they are still considered to be truth-biased. (See “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-default_theory">Truth Bias</a>”).</p>

  <title>Effort vs Results</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-June-7a/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Do not confuse effort with results.</p>
<p>Just because you put in the effort does not mean you’ll get the desired result.</p>
<p>A lot of effort gets undone long before results are felt. Going to the gym is undone if you eat poorly. Focusing only on work gets undone by the inevitable health and relationship issues that come from under-investment. When we try to speed up the outcome, our lack of patience undoes the result.</p>

<p>Writing fiction is an entirely personal process that takes place in a closed room. Shut away in a study, you sit at a desk and (in most cases) create an imaginary story out of nothing and put it in the form of writing. The formless and subjective is transformed into something tangible and objec-tive (or at least something that seeks to be objective). Defined sim-ply, this is the day-to-day work we novelists perform.I’m sure there are many people who will say, “But wait, I don’t have anything like a study.” The same was true for me when I started out writing—I had nothing resembling a study to work in. In my tiny apartment near the Hatonomori Hachiman Shrine in Sendagaya (in a building that’s since been torn down) I sat at the kitchen table late at night after my wife had gone to bed, scratching away with a pen on Japanese-style manuscript paper. That’s how I&nbsp;wrote my first two novels, Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973. “Kitchen-table” fiction is what I’ve dubbed these early works.<br>
<br>
When I first started writing Norwegian Wood, I wrote at cafés in various places in Greece, on board ferry boats, in the wait-ing lobbies of airports, in shady spots in parks, and at desks in cheap hotels. Hauling around oversized, four-hundred-character- per-page Japanese manuscript paper was too much, so in Rome I bought a cheap notebook (the kind we used to call college-ruled notebooks) and wrote the novel down in tiny writing with a dis-posable Bic pen. I still had to contend with noisy cafés, wobbly tables that made writing difficult, coffee spilling on the pages, and at night in my hotel room when I’d go over what I’d written, some-times there would be couples getting all hot and heavy beyond the paper-thin walls separating my room from the room next door. Things weren’t easy, in other words. I can smile at these memories now, but at the time it was all pretty discouraging. I had trouble finding a decent place to live, and moved all over Europe, all the while continuing to work on my novel. And I still have that thick old notebook, with its coffee stains (or whatever they are; I’m not really sure about some of them).<br>
<br>
Wherever a person is when he writes a novel, it’s a closed room, a portable study. That’s what I’m trying to say.</p>

  <title>Good Enough</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-June-5/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The perfect is the enemy of the good, often attributed to Voltaire. Yet we strive for the perfect and fail to achieve simple results. Perfectionism gets in the way of doing good stuff, ironically progress is hindered.</p>

  <title>Anger &amp; Wholesome Way</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-June-4/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Anger hurts you instead of the problem that generates it.</p>
<p>Thus, try to maintain a merely disappointed and annoyed attitude.</p>
<p>A more wholesome way to make a change, instead of becoming minimalist, vegan or move into a tiny house.</p>

  <title>Zanshin</title>
  <link>https://serhatbe.github.io/continuum/posts/2023-May-27/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="brief-summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-summary">Brief Summary</h2>
<p>Zanshin is a word used commonly throughout Japanese martial arts to refer to a state of relaxed alertness. Literally translated, zanshin means “the mind with no remainder.” In other words, the mind completely focused on action and fixated on the task at hand.&nbsp;<strong>Zanshin is being constantly aware of your body, mind, and surroundings without stressing yourself. It is an effortless vigilance.</strong></p>
<p>In practice, though, zanshin has an even deeper meaning. Zanshin is choosing to live your life intentionally and acting with purpose rather than mindlessly falling victim to whatever comes your way.</p>
<p>We can carry this philosophy into many areas of life.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Writing:</strong>&nbsp;The battle does not end when you publish a book. It ends when you consider yourself a finished product, when you lose the vigilance needed to continue improving your craft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fitness:</strong>&nbsp;The battle does not end when you hit a PR. It ends when you lose concentration and skip workouts or when you lose perspective and overtrain.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The enemy of improvement is neither failure nor success.&nbsp;<strong>The enemy of improvement is boredom, fatigue, and lack of concentration</strong>. The enemy of improvement is a lack of commitment to the process because the process is everything.</p>

<section id="choices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choices">Choices</h2>
<p>I tried several options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Static site generators, Jekyll-based options and Python scripts</p></li>
<li><p>Simple html files using Notepad++ to build a website to hold my notes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then I’m back to .md files using Zettlr, because it supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Math typesetting i.e.&nbsp;good <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX"> support.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy input of more commands in .md than in .html using Notepad++</p></li>
<li><p>Easy .html and .pdf generation</p></li>
<li><p>Citation built-in with Zotero</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But I discovered <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a> which is a scientific and technical publishing system utilizing <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. It does everything Zettlr does but in style. But Zettlr is still best for raw note-taking.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<ol type="1">
<li><p>Never lose sight of ultimate purpose, your physical and mental health: You’re sane and breathing this minute and may be gone forever the next minute. (Unknown, probably Aurelius) Maintain your physical fitness and sanity.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry, fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience becoming, to find out what’s inside you, to make your soul grow. – Kurt Vonnegut</p></li>
<li><p>No hurry, no pause: When you rush, time shrinks. When you’re relaxed, time expands. This is true even though it’s very hard for the mind to get. When you’re relaxed and doing something willingly, you’re participating in life. (Jon Schreiber, Breema Center)</p></li>
<li><p>You are what you think: Keep an untroubled spirit; for all things must bow to Nature’s Law (Marcus Aurelius)</p></li>
<li><p>Reflect on what you’ve read and written: Information becomes knowledge by reflection. Reflection cultivates intuition. abundant intuition makes up for lack of information thereby enabling you operate where your knowledge is limited. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Give your attention proportioned to the merits of the case: Sometimes full attention, sometimes none. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus not so much on words but on actual behavior. (Don’t watch his mouth, watch his hands. – Adler’s dictum).</p></li>
<li><p>Do not try to stay on top of things (you cannot). Instead try to get to the bottom of things. (This kind of success, while not guaranteed, will be more fulfilling than the former).</p></li>
<li><p>It is more important to invest in good people than in good ideas. (bet on the jockey not the horse).</p></li>
<li><p>Work expands to fill the time available for its completion (Parkinson’s law).</p></li>
<li><p>Perceive those things which cannot be seen (e.g.&nbsp;pay attention even to trifles). And do nothing which is of no use. (Miyamoto Musashi)</p></li>
<li><p>One who makes a show of valor is hated by others, even he achieves something, it is not praised but denied. (Kumazawa Banzan)</p></li>
<li><p>In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are only as good as your consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>We read the same facts differently. For an optimist philosopher the universe spells victory, for a pessimist, defeat. (William James, from Pragmatism and Other Writings).</p></li>
